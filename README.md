### 1. Introduction
A `static site generator` is a tool that generates a full static HTML website based on `raw data` and `a set of templates`. Essentially, a static site generator `automates the task of coding` individual HTML pages and gets those pages ready to serve to users ahead of time. Because these HTML pages are pre-built, they can load very quickly in users' browsers.

Static site generators are an alternative to `content management systems (CMS)` — another type of tool for managing web content, generating webpages, and implementing templates. (A template is a reusable format for web content; developers use templates to avoid writing the same formatting over and over.) Static site generators are typically part of a `JAMstack` web development approach.
